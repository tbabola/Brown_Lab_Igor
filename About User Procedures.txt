This is one of two special User Procedures folders.

The other is created by Igor 6.1 or later when Igor starts up, and is located here:

	<My Documents>\WaveMetrics\Igor Pro 6 User Files\User Procedures\

A simple way to locate that folder is to choose "Show Igor Pro 6 User Files" from Igor's Help Menu.

You can put Igor procedure files or aliases pointing to procedure files or to
folders containing procedure files in either of these User Procedures folders.

When Igor is compiling procedures and it encounters a line of the following form:

	#include "a file name"

it will look in both User Procedures folders and in any sub-folders for a procedure
file of the given name. It will also look at any files or folders referenced
by aliases. If the procedure file is found, Igor will automatically open it,
if it is not already open.

Such procedure files are called "shared" procedure files.

NOTE:
  If you put a procedure file in either User Procedures folder and then #include
  the file in an experiment then that experiment will require the procedure
  file to be available when the experiment is opened.
  
  If you transfer the experiment to another computer, you will need
  to transfer the procedure file also. If you forget the procedure
  file then the experiment will not work on the other computer.

NOTE:
  It is best if you save your own files in your own folder outside the
  Igor Pro Folder. This makes it possible for you to upgrade Igor in the
  future without worrying about losing your own files. 
  
  The Igor Pro 6 User Files\User Procedures folder is an ideal place for this.
